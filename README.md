Compares uncertainty estimation procedures for neural network regression

This code implements portions of the paper:

["A Study of the Bootstrap Method for Estimating the Accuracy of Artificial Neural
Networks in Predicting Nuclear Transient Processes"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1645061)

specifically investigating different ways of creating prediction intervals.
